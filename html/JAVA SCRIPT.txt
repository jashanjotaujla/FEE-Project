Invoking a JavaScript Function
The code inside a function is not executed when the function is defined.
The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked.
It is common to use the term "call a function" instead of "invoke a function".
It is also common to say "call upon a function", "start a function", or "execute a function".
In this tutorial, we will use invoke, because a JavaScript function can be invoked without being called.
